                    <h4 class="date">January 30, 2024</h6>
                   

                        <img class="modal-image" src="./blogs/blog-assets/LinkCC2023-80-1030x688.jpg">

                    <p>
                        In our last blog, we discussed integrative, functional, and naturopathic medicine as being similar medical approaches to caring for the Whole Person. Most people who access this type of healthcare are adults, but it’s just as important (arguably, more important) to approach healthcare for children holistically. In fact, Whole Child Health is an initiative promoted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that many organizations who care for children try to implement – including at Tacoma Public Schools. 
                    </p>
                    <h3><a>Lifelong health starts early</a></h3>
                    <p>
                        We’ll say it again – PREVENTION IS EVERYTHING! It cannot be overstated how important a healthy childhood is for a person’s lifelong health and longevity. Here are a few facts about childhood health that many people find surprising – including some who work in child healthcare: 
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Most forms of cardiometabolic diseases that adults are diagnosed with – e.g. type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease – have warning signs that show up before age 18. </li>
                        <li>Stress and hard life experiences are well-established risk factors for adult cardiovascular disease like heart attacks and strokes. Having high adverse experiences in childhood is directly linked to greater risk of cardiovascular disease in adulthood. Some studies have even shown this association remains when controlling for related risks like poverty and smoking. </li>
                        <li>Children whose parents/guardians have certain mental health conditions like bipolar disorder, ADHD, and anxiety are more likely to develop these conditions as adults.  </li>
                        <li>Children who receive multiple courses of antibiotics for frequent/recurrent illnesses such as ear infections are more like to develop diabetes and other metabolic health problems in adulthood. </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        These are just a few examples of why ‘good’ healthcare for children involves much more than regular visits with a pediatrician. Diligently caring for the health of a child requires care for the whole family.  
                    </p>

                    <h3><a>Early intervention requires regular healthcare visits </a></h3>

                    <p>
                        Right from birth, children grow and develop extremely quickly – it is truly a wonder to behold. This is why we adhere to the schedule for well-child visits that is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the CDC. Developmental screenings are performed at most early childhood visits so that we can intervene in areas that need support as soon as possible. Our community has a well-connected network of behavioral health and child development providers to call on when needed. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3><a>The hidden burden of stress in childhood</a></h3>

                    <p>
                        Adverse childhood experiences are potentially traumatic experiences that occur in childhood, such as suffering physical abuse or witnessing abuse between caregivers. It can also include experiences that threaten the stability of a child’s home or their attachment to caregivers—things like housing insecurity and caregiver substance use. Other stress and life adversity can have subtle but real effects on children when it affects a caregiver’s ability to recognize and respond to their children’s needs. When we meet families, we take time to ask lots of questions so that we can offer support in any of these areas if necessary. 
                    </p>

                    <h3><a>Children need positive experiences to thrive</a></h3>

                    <p>
                        On the flip side, positive experiences in childhood and healthy attachment with caregivers are very protective against the health risks of trauma. The conventional medical model is sometimes overly focused on “what’s wrong” and loses sight of “what’s right.” It is just as important to support healthy relationships and life-affirming activities for children as it is to protect them from harm. Your child’s pediatrician should be actively discussing positive parenting, healthy behaviors, education, and play at routine health checks.  
                    </p>

                        Integrative Medicine is often talked about interchangeably with Functional Medicine or Naturopathic Medicine—it can get confusing. Medicine is “integrative” when it brings together diagnostic techniques and medical treatments, regardless of what tradition they come from, to support your health and healing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At Link Community Clinic, our physicians are trained in naturopathic medicine, which is a distinct tradition with its own history and established set of principles. Naturopathic medicine often looks a lot like Integrative and Functional Medicine in its emphasis on lifestyle, prevention, and non-pharmaceutical therapies. These disciplines all typically address multiple health issues at the same time, with multiple techniques – for example, promoting exercise and mindfulness-based stress reduction in addition to medication for mental health concerns.
                    </p>

                    <h3><a>Medical approaches to Whole Person Health</a></h3>
                    <p>
                        As we discuss in our past blog on the subject, Whole Person Health involves looking at the whole person—not just a single disease or organ—and considering all the factors that influence one’s health. It requires recognizing not only how multiple systems of the body are connected, like the nervous system and the immune system, but also how one’s experiences, environment or habits influence those systems. Integrative, Functional, and Naturopathic medicine have all become distinctive professions with their own unique training programs and boards of certification. In practice, they can be very similar medical approaches to achieving Whole Person Health.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At our clinic, we don’t get too caught up in identity or philosophy. We just strive to put each person at the center of their own healthcare. Here’s how:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One’s medical care must be in line with their goals, values, and beliefs, which are almost impossible to assess in a typical 10–15-minute primary care visit. This is why we spend time to get to know our patients, empower them to take better care of themselves and their families/community, and make medical decisions together. Treatment also shouldn’t be detrimentally expensive or cause more harm than good. We pride ourselves on being the only naturopathic doctors in Pierce County who provide full primary care for people on Medicaid, and we’re very resourceful in seeking the right care for our patients.
                    </p>

                    <h3><a>How might this look for a patient at our clinic? </a></h3>
                    <p>
                        Consider someone needing help with chronic back pain. We take time to ask questions and get a thorough history—not just about the back pain, but about other things that relate to one’s overall health, e.g. diet, occupation, activity level, mental health. We perform as much or as little testing as is medically necessary, with an eye for prevention and identifying the root causes of an issue. We may discover the back pain is more prone to flare in times of stress or that certain foods cause more joint pain. The person may want to discuss trying acupuncture before medication for muscle spasms. We also may discover some underlying disease where more testing or referral to a specialist is needed.
                    </p>

                    <h3><a>Making Integrative Primary Care Accessible for all</a></h3>


                    <p>
                        Our process is to educate patients and help them feel empowered to make the best decision for them and their community. Unfortunately, a lot of providers that practice integrative or “holistic” medicine endorse tests that come with high out-of-pocket costs and do not help guide medical decision-making. These options should never take the place of a thorough workup, most of which is usually covered by insurance. (Do insurance companies fall short in taking care of people? All. The. Time. But that’s for another day.)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These providers may also recommend therapies that are very expensive and do not have well-established safety, especially when using them with other medications. Our providers stay updated on the scientific evidence and rationale for various supplements and when they’re worth using, or not worth it. We also recognize that not all disease can be prevented—sometimes you do everything right and still get sick. In these cases, we treat acute conditions as we’re able, and we refer to specialists when it’s necessary.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Whatever you label our type of medicine, it’s more satisfying for patients and providers alike. And everyone deserves this type of care.
                    </p>

                <p>
                    We received our first shipment of flu shots for the 2023-4 season today. Our vaccines are the preservative-free quadrivalent version. Flu shots are effective at reducing both incidence and severity of illness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 2022-3 season was severe, with at least 300,000 hospitalizations and 27 million cases (2022-2023 U.S. Flu Season: Preliminary In-Season Burden Estimates, 2023). We anticipate similar numbers this year. Typically, only half of adults in the US get the flu vaccine annually, which leaves a lot of vulnerable people unprotected.[...]

                        We received our first shipment of flu shots for the 2023-4 season today. Our vaccines are the preservative-free quadrivalent version. Flu shots are effective at reducing both incidence and severity of illness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The 2022-3 season was severe, with at least 300,000 hospitalizations and 27 million cases (2022-2023 U.S. Flu Season: Preliminary In-Season Burden Estimates, 2023). We anticipate similar numbers this year. Typically, only half of adults in the US get the flu vaccine annually, which leaves a lot of vulnerable people unprotected.[...]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will have a limited supply of flu vaccine and will distribute on a first-come, first-served basis. They are available for kids 6 months of age and older. We are still waiting on pediatric flu vaccines but anticipate their arrival by the end of September.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Commonly, we hear people tell us that they got the flu from the vaccine (10 flu Myths, 2020). This is not possible, as it is an inactivated vaccine. What is possible, and likely really common, is that you’ve gotten a similar virus about the same time as vaccination. We give flu vaccines in the fall as schools are starting, and as the first respiratory viruses of the season are going around.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Flu vaccine reduces, but does not eliminate, risk from this common virus. If you should get sick from the flu or a similar virus this fall, we recommend self-isolation until at least 24 hours after you are no longer having a fever. If you have a new onset viral infection, get registered for a quick telehealth appointment so we can discuss treatment, if indicated.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Speaking of viral illness, if you are sick on the day of your appointment, please let us know ahead of time and come into the clinic wearing a mask. We will give you access to our auxiliary waiting area to try to keep viral illness from spreading at the office. As much as possible, we will try to move acutely ill individuals to telehealth this fall and winter.
                    </p>

                    <h3><a>Artist Statement</a></h3>
                    <p>
                        Logic is found in the chaos around us.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the initial creation of a composition plan, the process begins from within, each layer exerting its influence on the next. Yet, even with meticulous plans, the movement of acrylic particles takes on a life of their own-shifting, sliding, and meandering unpredictably, It is in these moments of serendipity that chance lends its hand, giving rise to fractures and unforeseen textures. Gravity Assumes its role as arbiter, guiding individual pigments into graceful swirls and bleeds. It is within this dance of controlled chaos that true beauty comes to light – not birthed from sterile perfection, but rather shaped through deliberate choices, a pursuit to subdue disorder and mold it according to my vision.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Amidst this creative process, truth emerges; an eloquent metaphor for the world that surrounds us. While on the surface, chaos may reign; deeper inspection reveals the subtle threads of logic woven into the fabric of disorder. The very essence of life’s complexity finds its reflection in the interplay of pigments and pours, reminding us that even amidst turmoil, order and meaning persist, waiting to be deciphered.

                    <h4 class="date">September 15, 2023</h6>
                   
                        <img class="modal-image" src="./blogs/blog-assets/Whole-Body-Person-banner--1210x423.jpg">

                    <p>
                        The National Institutes of Health, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and other large health institutions are slowly but surely shifting their attention to Whole Person Health.   
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Whole Person Health involves looking at the whole person—not just separate organs or body systems—and considering all the factors that influence one’s health. It means empowering individuals, families, communities, and populations to improve their health in multiple interconnected area – biological, behavioral, social, and environmental.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Health and disease are not separate states – they occur on a path that can move in two different directions, either toward health or toward disease. On this path, many factors can lead to dysfunction of more than one organ system—e.g. genetics and family history; unhealthy behaviors like poor diet and sedentary lifestyle; chronic stress; and poor sleep. It’s important to recognize and address the factors that are supporting, lacking, or hurting one’s health. Instead of “fighting disease”, whole-person health focuses on restoring health, promoting resilience, and preventing diseases across the lifespan. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3><a>Naturopathic Care is better Primary Care</a></h3>


                    <p>
                        Both the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association’s latest guidelines recommend that all patients should have physician-led discussions about medication-free options to reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease, including healthy diet and physical activity. However, very few conventional medical providers receive even the most basic training in nutrition or counseling to be able to intelligently speak on the subjects with their patients. Naturopathic doctors, on the other hand, have several dozen hours of advanced clinical nutrition and counseling woven into their medical training. Getting to the root cause and treating the body as a whole, is an integral part of our scope of care. Patients at Link Community Clinic experience this difference when establishing primary care with us.  
                    </p>

                    <h3><a>Recognizing the health impacts of Social Inequalities</a></h3>

                    <p>
                        Social factors may have the largest impact on chronic disease—the systemic conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. It does not work to tell someone with food insecurity that they should simply eat more fruits and vegetables. Treating the Whole Person also means recognizing the health impacts of social inequalities and trauma that one may have experienced, and eventually intervening where it will make the most impact on one’s health.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By focusing on community care, disease prevention, healthy behaviors, and mental health, the Whole Person approach works to build resilience and sustain health throughout the lifespan. This is the approach we take to primary care at Link Community Clinic. Our physicians are trained in naturopathic medicine, which by philosophy and real-world approach is almost synonymous with Whole-person health, especially when it comes to primary care.  
                    </p>

                    <h3><a>Naturopathic Primary Care is empowering</a></h3>

                    <p>
                        Naturopathic primary care is effective in its whole-person health approach. Several research studies have shown naturopathic doctors to be successful at lowering patients’ risk of cardiovascular disease, treating depression and anxiety, and improving chronic conditions like diabetes, low back pain, and recurrent urinary tract infections. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        According to the 2012 National Health Interviews Survey, 67% of individuals who visited a naturopathic doctor were motivated to make one or more behavioral changes for their health, including quitting smoking, reducing alcohol use, increasing physical activity, and eating organic foods. Our doctors spend time with patients to explain evidence-based strategies for long-term health, including diet and lifestyle changes, in addition to all of the normal aspects of a primary care visit. We use every tool at our disposal to prevent disease or stop disease from worsening, including supplements, medication, and referrals to therapists or specialists. We understand that change is hard, so we make sure patients have the support they need to make their health changes sustainable.   
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Patients of naturopathic doctors are more satisfied with their care than the status quo. Naturopathic medicine is effective and well-liked by patients because the doctors listen – they take their time, they see the full picture, and they intervene where it’s most needed. 
                    </p>

                        <img class="modal-image" src="./blogs/blog-assets/Body-Positive-1024x702-1-300x206.jpeg">

                    <p>
                        To be body positive refers to the acceptance and non-stigmatization of all bodies regardless of size, shape, skin tone, gender, or physical ability [1].
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Céline Leboeuf, Author of What Is Body Positivity? The Path from Shame to Pride, states the body-positive movement is “often implicitly understood as the effort to celebrate diversity in bodily aesthetics and to expand our narrow beauty standards beyond their present-day confines [1].
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For health care, this means placing less emphasis on appearance-oriented (body image) goals and more focus on body function and health. Your health is not just about the number on the scale.
                    </p>

                    <h3><a>What is Body Positivity Care?</a></h3>

                    <p>
                        Caring for our bodies means not deriving self-worth and value from physical appearances.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As primary care providers, our goal isn’t to make you “look better,” but to help you feel better and support your quality of life.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You might’ve heard the saying “when you look good you feel good” before, and this might be true for a great blazer, but we believe “feeling good” comes from tuned-in, holistic care, or feeling well from within.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Body-positive care providers help patients feel less shame when speaking about their bodies. A person’s body image isn’t only about perceived image. There are various reasons someone’s appearance can change, from disease to mobility to mental health.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To find the root of any health issue, patients need to feel comfortable talking through causes, factors, and potential solutions with their doctor without fear of judgment.    
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        Just as it’s essential for psychiatrists and psychologists not to perpetuate shame or stigma onto mental health patients, the same rule applies to weight stigma and primary care physicians.
                
                    </p>

                    <h3><a>How can Body Positivity influence Holistic Care?</a></h3>

                    <p>
                        Body positivity facilitates honest and productive conversations between doctors and patients about physical and mental health. It’s easy to understand why many Naturopathic Physicians (ND) choose to embrace a body-positive or body-neutral approach.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Whole-Person or Holistic approach recognizes and supports the connection between physical and mental health and offers informed, preventative treatment. Because Holistic Care Providers will ask a wider variety of questions, it’s vital that patients feel safe to discuss anything connected to body image.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When patients feel at ease with their primary provider, they’re more likely to speak up about pain, be honest about habits, talk about the past, and be transparent about sensitive topics. Creating a safe environment for patients should be a top priority for any doctor, but especially for Holistic NDs who treat all aspects of your health.
                    </p>

                        Thinking about finding a body-positive care provider?

                    <p>
                        Ask yourself these questions:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Have you felt uncomfortable in traditional or past healthcare settings?</li>
                        <li>Are you tired of seeing multiple doctors/specialists and juggling appointments?</li>
                        <li>Are you feeling unresolved about current health issues?</li>
                        <li>Do you feel understood by your current providers?</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        With the end of COVID pandemic emergency measures, many Apple Health (Medicaid) clients must confirm eligibility for Apple Health, or enroll in alternative insurance options.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Clients can login to Washington Healthplanfinder to check their renewal status and update their contact information.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        King County provides free support for those who need assistance with re-enrollment or to enroll in alternative insurance options.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With the end of COVID pandemic emergency measures, thousands of King County residents and families need to take action to maintain their health insurance. And for many residents, action is needed by May 31, 2023.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “We don’t want anyone to go without the care they need because the right paperwork didn’t get filed – so if you have Apple Health coverage, or know anyone who does, please take steps to confirm or re-enroll,” said Dr. Faisal Khan, Director of Public Health—Seattle & King County.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During the pandemic, more than 100,000 King County residents were newly enrolled in Apple Health insurance coverage. Now, many people must confirm eligibility for Apple Health, or enroll in alternative insurance options. County residents are urged to update their contact information at www.wahealthplanfinder.org, or by calling either Healthplanfinder Customer Support at 1-855-923-4633 or the King County Community Health Access Program at 1-800-756-5437 – before June 1.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “Patients, providers, funders—we must all work together to get the word out about this important and quick way to keep people eligible for behavioral and physical healthcare,” said King County Department of Community and Human Services Director Leo Flor. “Apple Health is an important part of responding to the growing behavioral health needs in the region and ensuring that people have health coverage especially when facing financial hardships. By taking a couple simple steps to update your information and sharing awareness we can help our family and friends stay healthy.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Public Health—Seattle & King County and King County’s Department of Community and Human Services (DCHS) serve a large percentage of Apple Health clients both directly and indirectly. The King County Integrated Care Network (KCICN) in DCHS’ Behavioral Health and Recovery Division works directly with community behavioral health providers to serve Medicaid patients, including outpatient behavioral health services, substance use disorder residential treatment, and mental health programs.
                    </p>

                    <h3><a>Not all Apple Health members need to re-enroll.</a></h3>

                    <p>
                        Anyone whose renewal is due should receive a postcard, letter and other messages from the Washington Health Care Authority and Washington Healthplanfinder. However, if contact information has changed, they may not receive the notification. Clients can login to Washington Healthplanfinder to check their renewal status. The online enrollment process through Healthplanfinder can determine if a client is still eligible for Apple Health (also called Medicaid).
                    </p>

                    <P>
                        If someone is not eligible for Apple Health, there are other insurance options, like enrolling into a Cascade Care health plan that can cost less than $10 per month.
                    </P>

                    <p>
                        In April, more than 30,000 Apple Health enrollees in King County were first notified about potentially losing coverage after May 31. Renewal notices are sent out every month, on the anniversary of the month when someone first enrolled in Apple Health. For some people, eligibility can be determined automatically, but others need to take action to confirm or enroll in other programs. Outreach will continue over the next 12 months, as more people reach their renewal months.

                        <h3><a>May is Mental Health Awareness Month</a></h3>
                    <p>
                        May is Mental Health Awareness Month and May 18th is Mental Health Action Day. Mental illnesses are health conditions that affect a person’s thinking, feeling, behavior, mood, or a combination of these. These conditions deeply impact everyday living and may also affect a person’s ability to interact with and relate to others [1].
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you have — or think you might have — a mental illness, know that you are not alone. There is help available. Mental health conditions are far more common than you think. In the US, more than one in five adults experiences a mental health illness, and the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened mental health struggles for many people [1,2]. Mental health disorders can worsen symptoms of physical health conditions – like fatigue, high blood pressure, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, headache, skin conditions – or increase risk for conditions like heart disease and diabetes [3,4].
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Mental Illness Facts from the National Alliance for Mental Illness (NAMI) [1]:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>1 in 5 U.S. adults experience mental illness each year.</li>
                        <li>1 in 20 U.S. adults experience serious mental illness each year.</li>
                        <li>1 in 6 U.S. youth aged 6-17 experience a mental health disorder each year.</li>
                        <li>50% of all lifetime mental illness begins by age 14, and 75% by age 24.</li>

                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3><a>Mental Health Concerns are Worsened by Structural Inequities and Systemic Racism</a></h3>

                    <p>
                        In BIPOC communities (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) and other systematically minoritized populations like the LGBTQ+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Plus) community, mental health concerns are worsened by structural inequities and systemic racism [5]. Many community groups exist to increase awareness and access to care, and we have listed a few resources below.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you or someone you know has been struggling with sadness, worry, depression, anxiety, or difficulties with thoughts, feelings, or actions, we here at Link Community Clinic want you to know that there is help available. NAMI reminds us, “mental illnesses are not a result of personal weakness, lack of character or poor upbringing, and they cannot be overcome through willpower.” Effective treatments exist. An individualized treatment plan can range from counseling therapy, to medications, lifestyle changes, to mindfulness, or any combination of these treatments and more. Serious mental illnesses require specialized psychiatric care – and your primary care provider can help you connect to these specialists – however, much of mental illness care can be started and supported through the primary care provider’s office. If you feel you are struggling with mental illness and are seeking a whole person approach to your care, please call our office to meet with one of our doctors.

                    Every family needs access to a caring and knowledgeable primary care provider, which is increasingly difficult to find in our healthcare system these days. But health is also much more than what typically gets addressed in a doctor’s office—it’s the foods you eat, the quality of your relationships, and the ways you work, rest, and play. A family clinic shouldn’t just be somewhere to get prescriptions when you’re sick (we do that too), but a place that recognizes and supports the combination of factors that define health for your family.

                    <h3><a>Our naturopathic practice helps motivate preventative and behavioral health</a></h3>

                    <p>
                        According to the 2012 National Health Interviews Survey, 67% of individuals who visited naturopathic doctors (ND) were motivated to make one or more behavioral changes for their health, including smoking cessation, reducing alcohol consumption, increasing physical activity, and eating organic foods [1,2]. Clinical nutrition and lifestyle modification are significant components of naturopathic medical education. We spend time with patients to discuss evidence-based and pragmatic self-care therapies in addition to standard medical care. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association’s (ACC/AHA) guideline on the prevention of cardiovascular disease and the 2020 United States Preventive Services Task Force recommend physician-directed promotion of healthy diet and physical activity, as well as non-pharmacological options to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease [3,4]. That’s exactly what you’ll find here—we always address health and disease from a Whole Person perspective.
                    </p>

                    <h3><a>Our Whole Person perspective recognizes the connection between mental and physical health</a></h3>
                    <p>
                        The experiences of prolonged stress, isolation, financial insecurities, and grief affected most of us throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Even prior to the pandemic, a nationwide health study in 2018 resulted in an urgent call for improved quality of mental health and the prevention of mental health disorders like depression and anxiety, which are now among the leading causes of disability and decreased quality of life [5]. Naturopathic medicine recognizes the interconnectedness of our body systems and our minds, so mental and physical complaints are routinely addressed together. Our doctors routinely consider and discuss dietary, behavioral, physical, psycho-emotional contributors to health all at once [6,7]. For example, this multi-system approach is crucial in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, which is now known to be a disorder of the connection between the gut and the central nervous system. For patients with mental health challenges, we often initiate some counseling and discussion of mind-body therapies (e.g., mindfulness-based stress reduction, meditation) and make referrals to behavioral health or psychology.
                    </p>

                    <h3><a>Positive psychological health lowers risk and increases overall health</a></h3>

                    <p>
                        Even the American Heart Association acknowledges that psychological health is still largely overlooked in the conventional model of care and is major contributor to lifelong health [8]. Positive psychological health is associated with a lower risk for cardiovascular disease and greater healthy behaviors such as nutritious eating and more frequent exercise, which also reduce your risk for cancer and other serious diseases. As practitioners trained in both medical and mind-body therapies, our NDs are uniquely equipped to deliver primary care that simultaneously addresses mental and physical health—and we do it for patients throughout the lifespan, from babies to the elderly.

                        If you have been wanting to get more value and support from your family’s primary care provider, give us a call at (253) 267-1317 or register online via our portal and one of our staff will call you to schedule your first appointment.
