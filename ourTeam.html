She has worked as a trainer and has done dog fostering in the past and sees the value that having a furry companion can bring to someoneâ€™s life and mental well-being. Alynn goes above and beyond each day she is with us, goes out of her way to assist patients with needs, and is always thinking of ways to make the clinic more accessible and awesome than it already is.</p>
